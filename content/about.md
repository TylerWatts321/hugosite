I am a Junior at the University of Central Florida, and am due to graduate by Spring 2023. Computer Science is my current major; after I graduate I plan on enrolling in Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA) - UCF's graduate video game development program. When I am not studying for classes, cranking out school projects - or anything else school related - one can assume that I spend my free time playing video games... this is very true. I consider video games to be a cornerstone of my life growing up, and it is for this reason I have invested in learning the ways of game development today. I understand the feelings of escapism and enjoyment that come from playing video games... growing up these feelings have gotten me through harsh times of my own, and I have video games to thank for that. I hope one day I can create video games of my own that can help people get through what they may consider to be difficult times in their life as well.
