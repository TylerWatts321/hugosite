This past week I had the pleasure of working alongside a close friend of mine who I've known for a few years now, Slayde Kerner. Since 2015 Slayde has been teaching children through various forms of interactive media (3D Printing, MinecraftEDU, Music Software, 3D Modeling, etc.) through his STEM non-profit charitable educational academy known as Crafting Education Academy (CEA).

Slayde began this journey shortly before we had met each other in our freshman year of high school, and back then I never would've seen myself helping in the capacity that I found myself this past week. Slayde would always tell me various stories of kids in the program making the occasional bizarre comment or temper tantrum, but outside of that my knowledge of CEA was fairly limited. Throughout my highschool career I always found Slayde's passion for teaching, and sharing that same passion with his young students very inspiring; however I was disappointed to find out as much as I wanted to share in his passion I did not have much to offer to help Slayde. Flash forward to the tail end of 2021, and before I know it here I am teaching students the process of developing games in Unity.

At this point I had only been learning Unity and Game Development for a little under a year, but I felt I could bring enough to the table for Slayde, and felt comfortable enough to teach children enrolled in CEA's upcoming Winter Camp - a program created to entertain kids while they were on break from school. While I might've had the sufficient knowledge to teach these kids, it soon hit me upon my first day teaching that instructing kids Game Development is no easy feat. Granted, this fact should've been clear from the get-go, as game development isn't exactly a topic that one can easily dive into - there's a lot that goes into it. Game Development covers a wide range of concepts that hardly come easy to most adults.. let alone young children; topics such as Physics, Math, 3D Space and Graphics. I tried to incorporate these concepts as best as I could in my class through turning the focus of my ciriculum on the recreation of the classic retro game known as Space Invaders.

While I still faced some hiccups throughout the teaching process, I believe it's worth noting first how I structured the week-long course. As stated already, the goal of the course was to familiarize students with the Unity Game Engine, it's common techniques and features, as well as the design process. To accomplish this, I decided to recreate the classic game known as Space Invaders. To begin, I went over a presentation I created covering what a game engine actually is, the importance of engines, and finally examples of popular games made in Unity. Next came, what I believe to be the most important part of the course, analyzing the game in order to understand the different mechanics and rules at play that we need to implement. This includes questions such as: How does the player move? How do you win/lose the game? What actions does the player have? How fast does the player move? etc. Finallly came the actual game deving. This was broken down into chunks - first we got the player moving, then created our enemies and got them moving, then implemented shooting, etc. At the end we had a general prototype of space invaders.

So what problems did I face while covering the class? 

A major one was keeping the kids focused and entertained. I knew going into the class that this would be a problem, however I took some precautions like continually asking questions, guiding students through solutions instead of flat out giving them, leveraging the Visual Scripting Tool known as Bolt to avoid boring coding walkthroughs. Yet, the kids would still - as Slayde puts it - melt in their seats. There are a few approaches I could've applied to solve this issue however. One thing that would've helped would be to make more results more rapid. In other words, have the game come together more quickly either by condensing the visual scripting or providing the Bolt graphs to them and then explaining how they work after the fact instead of building the graphs alongside the children. One thing that helped me learn the game development process was actually seeing things happens on the screen. Needless to say this is probably even more applicable for children; they need to see results fast otherwise they will turn to something else and lose focus.

Another major problem I came across was that certain students were still getting tripped up over what many would consider to be simple features. For example, past the halfway point of the course there was a student still unsure of what Components were. Knowledge of Components is an important part of working with the dense library of GameObjects Unity has to offer, so this presented a huge problem. In retrospect, I think it would've benefited to create individual demo projects that showcase each of the tools that we planned on using before we used them. For example prior to setting up the player movement in our project, we could've spent more time going over how the Rigidbody component works, all of the fields we can adjust/modify, and how they effect the object in a sort of sandbox demo project.

Despite these problems I've faced throughout the teaching process this past week, I am still without a doubt ever grateful for the opportunity Slayde and everyone else at Crafting Education have given me. Juxtaposing the beginning of the new year, I feel that my time at CEA is ultimately marking the beginning of my career in the field of Game Development, and I am looking forward to working with CEA again in the future.
