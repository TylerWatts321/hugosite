summary: 
description: A recreation of the classic game Space Invaders - a 1978 shoot 'em up arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. Using Unity as my game engine, I created various assets necessary for the game and learned the fundamentals of creating games. This project was my first ever game project, and it taught me a lot about the fundamentals of game design, and what goes into making games.
responsibilities: Programming, created art assets, imported and hooked up sound/music, playtesting/balancing, setting up installer.

- Programmed various game mechanics; firing a laser, dying to an enemy laser, destroying the invaders, invaders get faster every time an invader   is destroyed, the various game states, etc. 

- Created the art assets in a program known as Aseprite.

- Hooked up the sounds into various events that occur in the game.

- Designed my own system responsible for tracking the invader game objects called EnemyTracker. This system proved useful when needing to determine which invaders were permitted to fire lasers. The source code for ```EnemyTracker.cs``` as well as other scripts can be found on my GitHub.

- I created an Audio Manager singleton, responsible for playing audio, and storing all the audio files to be played mid-game.
