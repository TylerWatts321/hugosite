- I was responsible for programming a lot of the combat mechanics into the game. I designed the enemy AI.

- I hooked up the character animations using Unity's Animation Controller.

- Created one map of the game "Catroth E3" - a desert map that has semi-limited resources. I play tested and fine tuned it as well.

- I designed a Unit Manager that kept track of all the combatant units in the game.

- I created an Audio Manager singleton, responsible for playing audio, and storing all the audio files to be played mid-game.

- I presented the game at the University of Central Florida Club, "Game Dev Knights", at the end of a game jam in which the game was initially developed.
